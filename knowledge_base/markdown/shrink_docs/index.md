## How do I get started with shrink research?

If you're investigating shrink in your store for the first time, follow this step-by-step process:

### Step 1: Review Your Inventory Recap Report (IRR)

The **Inventory Recap Report (IRR)** is the primary tool for investigating shrink in retail stores.

**What to do:**
1. Open the **IRR Dashboard** (this application)
2. Look at the **"Book vs SKU"** column - Shows shrink indicators by department
3. Identify departments where **Book is higher than SKU** (indicates likely shrink)
4. Focus on the **top 3-5 departments** with highest Book vs SKU variance

**Why this matters:** Book vs SKU variance is the best monthly predictor of shrink risk.

### Step 2: Understand What You're Seeing

**Read these guides to understand the IRR data:**
- **[Shrink Definition](01_core_concepts/shrink_definition.md)** - Understand what shrink is and how it's measured
- **[Book vs SKU Deep Dive](03_systems/book_vs_sku.md)** - Understand the variance and what it means
- **[Inventory Terminology](01_core_concepts/inventory_terminology.md)** - Learn key terms (Book, SKU, IRR, etc.)

### Step 3: Learn to Use the IRR System

**Master the IRR tool:**
- **[IRR Reporting](03_systems/irr_reporting.md)** - Complete guide to IRR and IRR Drilldown
- Understand all available metrics (Purchases, Sales, Markdowns, On-hand changes)
- Learn how to identify variance drivers

### Step 4: Investigate Root Causes

**Dig deeper into what's driving shrink:**
- **[Root Cause Analysis](02_processes/root_cause_analysis.md)** - Systematic investigation process
- Identify if variance is driven by SKU, Purchases, Markdowns, or Sales
- Use IRR Dashboard tabs to drill into specific categories

### Step 5: Implement Solutions

**Take action based on findings:**
- **[Troubleshooting Book vs SKU Variance](05_troubleshooting/book_sku_variance.md)** - Solutions for common causes
- Partner with Asset Protection for theft issues
- Review relevant process guides for operational improvements

### Step 6: Get Quick Answers

**Check FAQ for common questions:**
- **[Common Questions](04_faqs/common_questions.md)** - Quick answers to frequent shrink questions
- Search for specific topics (markdowns, on-hands, receiving, etc.)

## What should I remember about shrink research?

**Key Principles:**
1. **Always start with the Inventory Recap Report (IRR)** - It's your roadmap showing where shrink is happening
2. **Book vs SKU variance is a predictor, not actual shrink** - Actual shrink is only measured during physical inventory
3. **Identify the variance driver first** - Don't investigate everything; focus on what's actually driving the problem
4. **Use Custom Reports** - When you identify a driver (like purchases), go to Custom Reports tab for details
5. **Partner with Asset Protection** - Theft requires AP expertise and resources

**Remember:** Effective shrink management is proactive. Use the IRR monthly to identify and address issues before they become major problems.
