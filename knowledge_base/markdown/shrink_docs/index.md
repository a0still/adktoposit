# Using This Documentation

This documentation is organized to help you:
1. Understand core concepts about shrink and inventory
2. Learn key processes and procedures
3. Navigate relevant systems and tools
4. Find important references and resources

Each section builds on the previous ones, so it's recommended to start with the core concepts if you're new to this topic.

## Getting Started - How to Research Shrink

**If you're new and want to research shrink in your store, start here:**

1. **Review your Inventory Recap Report (IRR)** - This is your primary tool for investigating shrink
   - Look at the "Book vs SKU" column - this shows shrink indicators for further research by department
   - Identify which departments have the highest variance (where Book is higher than SKU)
   - Focus on the top 3-5 departments with highest shrink indicators

2. **Understand what you're seeing** - Read [Shrink Definition](01_core_concepts/shrink_definition.md) and [Book vs SKU](03_systems/book_vs_sku.md)

3. **Learn to use the IRR** - Review [IRR Reporting](03_systems/irr_reporting.md) to understand all the metrics available

4. **Investigate causes** - Use [Root Cause Analysis](02_processes/root_cause_analysis.md) to dig deeper into what's driving shrink

5. **Get answers** - Check [Common Questions](04_faqs/common_questions.md) for quick answers to frequent shrink questions

**Remember**: Always start your shrink research with the Inventory Recap Report (IRR). It's your roadmap showing where shrink is happening in your store.
