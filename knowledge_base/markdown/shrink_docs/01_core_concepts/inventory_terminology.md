# Retail Inventory Terminology Guide

## What does IRR stand for?

**IRR** = **Inventory Recap Report**

The **Inventory Recap Report (IRR)** is a monthly report that provides financial inventory information for each department in the store.

**Purpose of the IRR:**
- Used as the starting point for researching shrink drivers
- Shows purchases, sales, markdowns, Book inventory, SKU inventory, and Book vs SKU variance
- Helps identify which categories are causing shrink risk in the store
- Provides shrink **indicators** for further investigation (not actual shrink, which is measured during physical inventory)

**Key Point:** The IRR shows **predictors and indicators** of potential shrink, not the actual shrink number.

## What is Book Inventory?

**Book Inventory** = **Financial Inventory** = **Book** (all three terms mean the same thing)

The **Book Inventory** represents the **financial value** that retail merchandise accounts show the store should have.

**Key Characteristics:**
- Based on financial transactions (purchases, sales, markdowns, adjustments)
- Updated with every financial transaction
- What the accounting records say the store should have
- Used to calculate actual shrink on inventory day

**Formula:**
- **Book Inventory** = Beginning Book + Purchases - Sales - Markdowns + Adjustments

## What is SKU Inventory?

**SKU Inventory** = **On-Hands** = **PI (Perpetual Inventory)** (all three terms mean the same thing)

The **SKU Inventory** represents the **non-financial, system-calculated value** based on the on-hand quantities the system thinks the store has.

**Key Characteristics:**
- Based on system on-hand counts (approximately 50% accurate)
- Calculated from current on-hands × current retail price
- Updates when on-hands are adjusted or prices change
- Does **NOT** count for or against the store on physical inventory day
- Informative for daily operations and customer service

**Important:** While SKU inventory helps with daily operations and accurate on-hands play a vital role in servicing customers, **SKU inventory does not determine actual shrink**. Only the physical count matters on inventory day.

## What is Physical Count or Inventory Count?

**Physical Count** = **Inventory Count** (both terms mean the same thing)

The **Physical Count** refers to the actual count performed by the inventory crew on **inventory day** (once per year).

**Key Characteristics:**
- Performed annually on inventory day
- Involves physically scanning and counting all merchandise in the store
- The counted value is compared to Book Inventory to calculate actual shrink
- The **only** time actual shrink is officially measured

**Formula for Actual Shrink:**
- **Actual Shrink** = Book Inventory - Physical Count

**Why It Matters:**
- Physical Count determines the true shrink number
- Book vs SKU variance (shown monthly on the IRR) is a predictor, but Physical Count is the reality
- This count happens only once per year, so monthly monitoring via the IRR is critical

## What is the difference between Book and SKU?

**Book vs SKU Variance** is the difference between what the financial records say the store should have (Book) and what the system thinks the store has (SKU).

**Key Differences:**

| **Aspect** | **Book Inventory** | **SKU Inventory** |
|------------|-------------------|-------------------|
| **Definition** | Financial records | System on-hands calculation |
| **Accuracy** | Based on transactions | Approximately 50% accurate |
| **Used for** | Financial reporting, shrink calculation | Daily operations, replenishment |
| **Updates** | Every financial transaction | On-hand adjustments, price changes |
| **Counts on Inventory Day?** | Yes - compared to Physical Count | No - only Physical Count matters |

**Why the Variance Matters:**
- When **Book is higher than SKU**, this indicates the store is likely to experience shrink
- The variance serves as an early warning system to identify and fix problems **before** physical inventory
- High variance = High likelihood of shrink = Need for immediate investigation

## How do these terms relate to shrink?

Understanding the relationship between these terms is essential for shrink management:

**Monthly Shrink Indicator:**
- **Book vs SKU Variance** = Best monthly predictor of shrink
- Tracked on the **Inventory Recap Report (IRR)**
- Helps identify problems early

**Annual Shrink Measurement:**
- **Actual Shrink** = Book Inventory - Physical Count
- Measured once per year on inventory day
- The official shrink number that impacts financial statements

**Example:**
- If **Book** = $100,000 and **SKU** = $95,000, then **Book vs SKU Variance** = $5,000
- This $5,000 variance indicates the store is likely to experience shrink
- On inventory day, if **Physical Count** = $96,000, then **Actual Shrink** = $100,000 - $96,000 = $4,000
