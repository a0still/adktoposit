## Aligning Terminology

### IRR (Inventory Recap Report)
The acronym **"IRR"** stands for **"Inventory Recap Report"**, which is a monthly report that has financial inventory information for each department to be used as a starting point for researching shrink drivers. It shows purchases, sales, markdowns, Book inventory, SKU inventory, and Book vs SKU variance - helping you identify which categories are causing shrink risk in your store. This report should be used to research shrink indicators for further investigation, and is not actual shrink (which is measured during physical inventory).

### Book Inventory
The term **"book"** or **"Book Inventory"** is often used interchangeably with **financial inventory**. They mean the same thing.

We're talking about the **financial value** that our retail merchandise accounts show that we have.

### SKU Inventory
Here we're talking about **on-hands** or **PI** (Perpetual Inventory). These terms are often used interchangeably to mean the same thing.

This is the **non-financial value** that our systems calculate based on the on-hands we have and the value of those on-hands. SKU inventory can be informative, and accurate on-hands play a vital role in servicing our customers, but it **won't count for or against us on inventory day**.

### Physical Count / Inventory Count
The last two we have are **physical count** or **inventory count**. What this is referring to is the count our inventory crew does on **inventory day**, and the calculation of the value of that merchandise on that day. So these terms really only come to be once a year.
