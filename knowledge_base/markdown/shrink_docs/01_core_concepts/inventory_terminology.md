## Aligning Terminology

### Book Inventory
The term **"book"** or **"Book Inventory"** is often used interchangeably with **financial inventory**. They mean the same thing.

We're talking about the **financial value** that our retail merchandise accounts show that we have.

### SKU Inventory
Here we're talking about **on-hands** or **PI** (Perpetual Inventory). These terms are often used interchangeably to mean the same thing.

This is the **non-financial value** that our systems calculate based on the on-hands we have and the value of those on-hands. SKU inventory can be informative, and accurate on-hands play a vital role in servicing our customers, but it **won't count for or against us on inventory day**.

### Physical Count / Inventory Count
The last two we have are **physical count** or **inventory count**. What this is referring to is the count our inventory crew does on **inventory day**, and the calculation of the value of that merchandise on that day. So these terms really only come to be once a year.
