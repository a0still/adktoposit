# Retail Shrink Definition and Management Guide

## What is the definition of shrink?

**Shrink** refers to the loss of inventory value in retail stores. In Walmart retail operations, **shrink** specifically means **losses to retail department accounts** that impact profitability.

**Key Definition:**
- **Shrink** = The financial loss when physical inventory counted is less than the Book inventory (financial records)
- **Book Inventory** = What the financial records say the store should have
- **Physical Count** = What is actually scanned and counted during the annual physical inventory
- **Shrink Amount** = Book Inventory minus Physical Count

## Where can I see shrink indicators in my store?

The **Inventory Recap Report (IRR)** shows shrink indicators that help identify where losses are likely occurring:

**Key Shrink Indicators on the IRR:**
- **Book vs SKU variance** - The primary shrink predictor (when Book is higher than SKU)
- **Markdowns higher or lower than normal** - May indicate aged inventory or improper markdowns
- **Purchases higher or lower than normal** - May indicate receiving errors or vendor issues
- **Sales patterns** - Unusual sales drops may indicate theft or operational problems

**How to interpret the indicators:**
- When **Book inventory is higher than SKU** (system on-hand inventory), that difference indicates the store will likely experience shrink
- The IRR shows shrink indicators by department including: Book, SKU, markdowns, purchases, and sales
- Higher variance = Higher likelihood of shrink

## What causes shrink in retail stores?

Shrink in retail operations results from multiple factors:

### Main Causes of Shrink:

1. **Missing Merchandise**
   - External theft (shoplifting)
   - Internal theft (employee theft)
   - Shortage from vendors
   - Lost or misplaced items

2. **Improper Financial Transactions**
   - Price changes based on inaccurate on-hand counts
   - Inaccurate billing from vendors
   - Receiving errors (wrong quantities recorded)
   - Markdown errors (incorrect price reductions)

3. **Inaccurate Inventory Counts**
   - Counting errors on physical inventory day
   - Associates not following proper scanning procedures
   - On-hand adjustments without investigation
   - Wrong department receiving

## How do I research and investigate shrink?

Follow this systematic approach to research shrink using the **Inventory Recap Report (IRR)**:

### Step 1: Identify High-Shrink Departments
- Review the **Inventory Recap Report (IRR)** to find departments with the highest Book vs SKU variance
- Look for departments where inventory levels are growing faster than sales
- Focus on the top 3-5 departments contributing to shrink risk

### Step 2: Analyze the Variance Drivers
- Check the **purchases column** - Are purchases higher or lower than normal for this department?
- Check the **markdowns column** - Are markdowns higher or lower than expected?
- Review **SKU changes** - Are on-hands being adjusted frequently?
- Examine **sales patterns** - Are sales lower than expected given inventory levels?

### Step 3: Partner with Leadership and Asset Protection
- Share IRR findings with your supervisor or sponsor
- Partner with **Asset Protection (AP)** to investigate theft indicators
- Request AP review of camera footage for high-shrink departments
- Implement AP recommendations for security improvements

### Step 4: Look for Trends Over Time
- Compare current month IRR to previous months
- Is shrink variance increasing or remaining consistent?
- Are the same departments showing problems month after month?
- Is the variance growing or shrinking with interventions?

### Step 5: Use Root Cause Analysis
- Apply the "5 Whys" method to dig deeper into specific issues
- Interview associates working in high-shrink departments
- Review transaction logs and adjustment history
- Verify physical counts match system on-hands

## How do I measure shrink accurately?

**Actual shrink is only measured once per year** during the physical inventory count:

**Shrink Measurement:**
- **Annual Physical Inventory** = The only time actual shrink is calculated
- **Book vs SKU Variance** = Monthly predictor/indicator of potential shrink (NOT actual shrink)
- **Shrink Percentage** = (Shrink Amount ÷ Total Sales) × 100

**Important Distinction:**
- **Book vs SKU variance** shows **likelihood** of shrink and helps identify problems early
- **Actual shrink** is the confirmed financial loss measured during physical inventory
- The IRR Dashboard tracks **indicators**, not the actual shrink number
