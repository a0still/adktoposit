## Defining Shrink

In Walmart, when we say **"shrink"**, we're almost exclusively talking about **losses to our retail department accounts**.

**Where to See It:**  
Review your **Inventory Recap Report (IRR)** - shrink indicators can be variances such as the "Book vs SKU" variance, markdowns higher or lower than normal or purchases higher or lower than normal. When Book inventory is higher than SKU (system on-hand) inventory, that difference is your most likely indicator that a store will shrink. The IRR shows shrink indicators for further research by department (book, sku, markdowns, purchases and sales), helping you identify where losses are likely occurring.

**What Causes Shrink:**

Shrink can be the result of:

* Missing merchandise from shortage, theft, etc.
* Improper financial transactions such as a price change based on a bad on-hand count or an inaccurate billing.
* Inaccurate counts on inventory day.

**How to Research Shrink:**

1. Start with your **Inventory Recap Report (IRR)** to see which departments have the highest Book vs SKU variance or inventory levels growing faster than sales.
2. Focus on the top 3-5 departments contributing to your shrink
3. Look at your purchases and markdowns columns first to see if they are higher or lower than normal.
4. Partner with your supervisor/sponsor and Asset Protection (AP) to investigate causes
5. Look at trends over time - is shrink increasing or consistent?
6. Use root cause analysis to dig deeper into specific issues
