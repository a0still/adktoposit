## Defining Shrink

In Walmart, when we say **"shrink"**, we're almost exclusively talking about **losses to our retail department accounts**.

**Where to See It:**  
Review your **Inventory Recap Report (IRR)** - shrink appears as the "Book vs SKU" variance. When Book inventory is higher than SKU (physical) inventory, that difference is your shrink. The IRR shows shrink by department, helping you identify where losses are occurring.

**What Causes Shrink:**

Shrink can be the result of:

* Missing merchandise from shortage, theft, etc.
* Improper financial transactions such as a price change based on a bad on-hand count or an inaccurate billing.
* Inaccurate counts on inventory day.

**How to Research Shrink:**

1. Start with your **Inventory Recap Report (IRR)** to see which departments have the highest Book vs SKU variance
2. Focus on the top 3-5 departments contributing to your shrink
3. Partner with your supervisor/sponsor and Asset Protection (AP) to investigate causes
4. Look at trends over time - is shrink increasing or consistent?
5. Use root cause analysis to dig deeper into specific issues
