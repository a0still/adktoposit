# Frequently Asked Questions - Retail Operations & Shrink

## Shrink Basics

### What is shrink?

**Answer:**  
Shrink refers to the loss of inventory between what is recorded (Book inventory) and what is physically counted (During annual inventory). In retail, shrink represents financial losses due to missing merchandise, theft, damaged goods, or errors in inventory management.

**Where to See It:**  
Review your **Inventory Recap Report (IRR)** - shrink indicators can be variances such as the "Book vs SKU" variance, markdowns higher or lower than normal or purchases higher or lower than normal. When Book inventory is higher than SKU (system on-hand) inventory, that difference is your most likely indicator that a store will shrink. The IRR shows shrink indicators for further research by department (book, sku, markdowns, purchases and sales), helping you identify where losses are likely occurring.

**Key Points:**
- Shrink is measured during physical inventory as the difference between Book and actual physical count
- Book vs SKU variance is the best monthly indicator/predictor of shrink
- Main causes include theft (internal and external), administrative errors, vendor fraud, and damaged merchandise
- Shrink directly impacts profitability and store performance metrics
- The IRR Dashboard shows shrink indicators for further research by department (book vs sku, markdowns, purchases and sales), helping you identify problem areas

### What are the main causes of shrink?

**Answer:**  
The four main causes of shrink are: 1) External theft (shoplifting), 2) Internal theft (employee theft), 3) Administrative errors (pricing mistakes, receiving errors, inventory count mistakes), and 4) Vendor fraud or errors (short shipments, billing errors).

**Key Points:**
- External theft typically accounts for 35-40% of shrink
- Internal theft accounts for 30-35% of shrink
- Administrative and paperwork errors represent 20-25%
- Vendor fraud accounts for 5-10%
- Prevention strategies differ for each type

### How do I reduce shrink in my store?

**Answer:**  
To investigate shrink causes, partner with your supervisor/sponsor and start your research using the **Inventory Recap Report (IRR)** to help identify what is driving your shrink growth. Focus on departments with high Book vs SKU variance, low markdowns, high purchases, or low sales.

**Steps:**
1. **Review your Inventory Recap Report (IRR)** - Identify departments with highest Book vs SKU variance (your best shrink predictor)
2. **Analyze by department** - Focus on the top 3-5 departments contributing to shrink
3. **Improve inventory accuracy** - Look at your purchases and markdowns columns first to see if they are higher or lower than normal.
4. **Partner with Asset Protection** - Share IRR results and address external and internal theft proactively
5. **Train associates** - Ensure proper procedures for markdowns, receiving, and inventory adjustments
6. **Monitor key IRR metrics** - Track Book vs SKU, markdown dollars, and purchase variance monthly
7. **Address root causes** - Don't just fix symptoms, investigate why shrink is occurring

**Common Mistakes:**
- Focusing only on theft without addressing operational issues
- Inconsistent inventory practices across departments
- Not following up on identified issues
- Waiting until inventory day to address problems

## Book vs SKU

### What is Book vs SKU?

**Answer:**  
Book inventory represents the financial record of what inventory SHOULD be in the store based on purchases, sales, and transactions. SKU inventory represents the system onhand amounts of what IS actually in the store.  The difference between Book and SKU is the best predictor of shrink. Actual shrink is measured during physical inventory as the difference between Book and the physical count.

**Key Points:**
- Book = Financial records (what you should have)
- SKU = System on-hand inventory (what your system says you have, ~50% accurate)
- Book vs SKU variance = Best predictor/indicator of shrink
- Actual shrink = Book minus physical count (measured during physical inventory)

### Why is my Book vs SKU variance so high?

**Answer:**  
High Book vs SKU variance on your **Inventory Recap Report (IRR)** indicates significant shrink risk in your store or department. Start by reviewing the IRR to identify which specific departments are driving the variance. Common causes include theft (external or internal), inventory inaccuracy (counting errors, on-hand adjustments), receiving errors, markdown mistakes, or failure to process damaged merchandise properly.

**Investigation Steps:**
1. **Review your IRR Dashboard** - Identify which departments show the highest Book vs SKU variance, review the AI insights for support.
2. **Check for theft patterns** - Review AP reports and camera footage for high-shrink items in those departments
3. **Review inventory accuracy** - Compare recent scans of high-value items, look for on-hand adjustment patterns
4. **Audit recent transactions** - Check markdowns, receiving, and transfers for errors in affected departments
5. **Review high-value items** - Use the IRR to focus on expensive items that impact dollars significantly

**Common Causes:**
- Shoplifting in high-risk departments (Electronics, Cosmetics, etc.)
- Internal theft or merchandise use
- On-hand count errors when scanning items
- Receiving errors (not checking in merchandise properly)
- Markdown errors (taking markdowns without proper justification)
- Damaged merchandise not processed correctly

### What impacts Book but not SKU?

**Answer:**  
Certain financial transactions affect your Book inventory (financial records) but don't change SKU inventory (system on-hands) until a specific action is taken.

**Things that impact ONLY Book:**
- Home Office journal entries
- EDI releases for payment
- PODs (Proof of Delivery)
- CFT payments (e.g., alcohol)
- Pre-charged invoices
- Credit memos
- Claim chargebacks
- Auto MTRs (financial transfers)
- After-inventory adjustments (month after inventory only)

**Why This Matters:**  
These transactions can create Book vs SKU variance temporarily. Understanding them helps you investigate discrepancies and know when they're expected vs. problematic.

### What impacts SKU but not Book?

**Answer:**  
Physical inventory changes affect SKU but don't update Book until the financial transaction is complete.

**Things that impact ONLY SKU:**
- On-hand changes (adjustments)
- Scanned out stolen
- Inventory increases
- Inventory decreases
- Open receivings (finalized) - Dollar value impacts Book only on inventory day

**Why This Matters:**  
When you adjust on-hands or process stolen merchandise, it immediately affects your system on-hands (SKU) but the financial record (Book) may not update until month-end or inventory day. This creates temporary variance that's expected and acceptable.

## Markdowns

### What causes high markdowns?

**Answer:**  
Review your **Inventory Recap Report (IRR)** to see which departments have the highest markdown dollars. High markdowns are typically caused by: overstock situations requiring clearance, seasonal merchandise not sold timely, damaged or defective merchandise, price corrections, competitive pricing adjustments, or poor inventory management leading to aged inventory.

**Common Scenarios:**
- **Seasonal goods** - Halloween, Christmas, Summer items not sold before season ends (check IRR after each season)
- **Overstock** - Ordered too much, need to clear space
- **Damaged merchandise** - Items damaged in store or received damaged
- **Price corrections** - Incorrect original pricing
- **Clearance** - Discontinuing items or making room for new merchandise
- **Competitive pressure** - Matching competitor pricing

**Prevention Strategies:**
- Order accurately based on historical sales
- Monitor sell-through rates during season
- Mark down seasonal items earlier (don't wait until after season)
- Process damaged merchandise promptly
- Verify pricing when receiving merchandise
- Review markdown reports weekly to identify trends

### How do I reduce markdown dollars?

**Answer:**  
Use your **Inventory Recap Report (IRR)** to identify departments with the highest markdown dollars, then focus your efforts there. Reduce markdowns by ordering more accurately, marking down seasonal items earlier in the season, processing damaged goods promptly, monitoring high-markdown departments, and ensuring proper pricing from the start.

**Action Steps:**
1. **Review IRR monthly** - Identify which departments have highest markdown dollars
2. **Order smarter** - Use historical data from IRR trends, don't over-order trendy items
3. **Mark down earlier** - Take smaller markdowns early vs. deep markdowns late
4. **Process damages quickly** - Don't let damaged items sit on shelves
5. **Monitor trends** - Compare current IRR to previous months to catch increases early
6. **Train associates** - Ensure proper markdown procedures are followed
7. **Partner with merchandising** - Share IRR data and communicate slow-moving items early

### When should I take a markdown?

**Answer:**  
Take markdowns when merchandise is damaged, defective, seasonal and approaching end-of-season, significantly overstocked, or when directed by corporate markdown guidelines. Always follow company policies and document the reason.

**Guidelines:**
- **Damaged merchandise** - As soon as damage is identified
- **Seasonal items** - 2-3 weeks before season ends (don't wait!)
- **Overstock** - When inventory levels are 150%+ of normal
- **Clearance items** - Follow corporate markdown schedule
- **Competitive pricing** - Only when authorized

**Important Notes:**
- Always follow markdown authorization limits
- Document the reason in the system
- Ensure markdown is appropriate for the situation
- Don't take markdowns to "manage" shrink artificially
- Verify on-hand accuracy before markdown

## Inventory Management

### How do I improve on-hand accuracy?

**Answer:**  
Improve on-hand accuracy through scanning high-value or high-theft items regularly, proper receiving procedures, accurate markdown processing, immediate processing of damaged merchandise, training associates on proper procedures, and investigating discrepancies promptly.

**Best Practices:**
1. **Scan high-value/high-theft items regularly** - Adjust on-hands as needed and ensure daily inventory processes are followed
2. **Verify at receiving** - Count everything that comes in, don't trust BOL
3. **Process changes immediately** - Don't delay adjustments, markdowns, or damages
4. **Train your team** - Ensure everyone knows proper procedures
5. **Investigate discrepancies** - When counts are off, find out why
6. **Use tools correctly** - Handheld devices, inventory management systems

**Common Issues:**
- Not scanning high-value items regularly or adjusting on-hands accurately
- Delaying processing of markdowns or damaged items
- Not verifying receiving quantities
- Associates adjusting on-hands without investigation
- Poor communication between shifts

### How often should I adjust inventory?

**Answer:**  
Only adjust inventory when you have identified a legitimate discrepancy through scanning items or investigation. Never adjust on-hands to "fix" reports or meet targets. Every adjustment should be documented with a clear reason.

**When to Adjust:**
- After scanning confirms count differs from system
- After investigating and finding merchandise in wrong location
- After receiving corrections are verified
- When processing damaged/defective merchandise
- Following theft documentation by Asset Protection

**When NOT to Adjust:**
- To make reports "look better"
- Without physically counting the merchandise
- Based on assumptions or estimates
- To cover up potential theft without investigation
- Just before inventory without verification

**Important:** Every adjustment should have a clear, documented reason. Unexplained adjustments can indicate theft or poor practices.

## IRR Dashboard

### What is the IRR report?

**Answer:**  
The Inventory Recap Report (IRR) is a monthly financial report that shows your store's inventory performance, including purchases, sales, markdowns, Book inventory, SKU inventory, and Book vs SKU variance. It's the primary tool for monitoring shrink and inventory health.

**Key Components:**
- **Purchases** - Merchandise bought (finalized invoices)
- **Sales** - Merchandise sold to customers
- **Markdowns** - Price reductions taken
- **Book** - Financial inventory (what you should have)
- **SKU** - System on-hand inventory (what your system says you have, ~50% accurate)
- **Book vs SKU** - Your best shrink indicator (the difference between financial records and system on-hands)

**How to Use It:**
- Review monthly with your team
- Compare to previous months to identify trends
- Focus on departments with highest variance
- Use data to guide which high-value/high-theft items to scan regularly
- Partner with AP on high-shrink areas

**Related Topics:** [IRR Reporting](../03_systems/irr_reporting.md)

### How do I read the IRR dashboard?

**Answer:**  
The IRR dashboard shows inventory metrics by department. Key areas to focus on: Book vs SKU variance (your shrink), markdown dollars (losses from price reductions), and purchases (merchandise coming in). Look for departments with high variance or unusual patterns.

**Reading the Dashboard:**
1. **Start with totals** - Overall store Book vs SKU variance
2. **Identify high-variance departments** - Which depts have biggest losses?
3. **Check markdown dollars** - Are markdowns excessive in any area?
4. **Review purchases** - Are there unusual spikes or drops?
5. **Compare to previous months** - Are trends improving or worsening?

**Red Flags:**
- Book vs SKU variance increasing month-over-month
- Negative variance (SKU higher than Book) - investigate immediately
- Markdown dollars significantly higher than normal
- Purchase variance that can't be explained

## Processes & Procedures

### How do I do a root cause analysis?

**Answer:**  
Root cause analysis involves systematically investigating a problem to find the underlying cause, not just the symptom. For shrink issues, use the "5 Whys" method, review data and reports, interview associates, check camera footage if available, and document findings.

**5 Whys Method:**
1. **State the problem** - "Department 72 has $5,000 Book vs SKU variance"
2. **Ask Why #1** - "Why is there variance?" → "Multiple items are missing"
3. **Ask Why #2** - "Why are items missing?" → "High-value items disappearing"
4. **Ask Why #3** - "Why are high-value items disappearing?" → "No one is monitoring that aisle"
5. **Ask Why #4** - "Why is no one monitoring?" → "We didn't know it was a problem"
6. **Solution** - Implement increased monitoring, daily scans of high-value items with on-hand adjustments, AP presence

**Investigation Steps:**
1. Identify the problem specifically (what, where, when)
2. Gather data (reports, counts, observations)
3. Interview associates who work in that area
4. Review transactions and recent changes
5. Partner with AP to review footage if theft suspected
6. Document findings and implement solution
7. Follow up to verify solution worked

### How do I partner with Asset Protection?

**Answer:**  
Effective AP partnership involves regular communication, sharing shrink data and concerns, implementing recommended security measures, following up on incidents, and creating a culture where associates understand both operational and security aspects of shrink prevention.

**Best Practices:**
- Schedule regular meetings to review shrink data
- Share IRR results and high-shrink departments
- Report suspicious activity promptly
- Implement AP recommendations (cameras, EAS tags, etc.)
- Ensure associates know proper procedures
- Balance customer service with theft deterrence
- Don't try to apprehend shoplifters yourself

**What to Share with AP:**
- Departments with high shrink
- Items frequently missing
- Suspicious customer or associate behavior
- Patterns in shrink (time of day, day of week)
- Upcoming high-risk events (sales, holidays)
