## Book vs. SKU Deep Dive

### What is Book vs SKU?

**Book vs SKU variance is the BEST PREDICTOR/INDICATOR of shrink, NOT actual shrink itself.**

- **Book inventory** = Financial records (what you should have based on transactions)
- **SKU inventory** = System on-hand inventory (what your system says you have, ~50% accurate)
- **Book vs SKU variance** = The difference between Book and SKU, which indicates RISK or LIKELIHOOD of shrink
- **Actual shrink** = Book minus physical count during physical inventory (measured once per year)

**Key Point:** When Book is higher than SKU, that difference shows you are LIKELY to experience shrink on inventory day. It's your warning signal, not the actual loss itself.
