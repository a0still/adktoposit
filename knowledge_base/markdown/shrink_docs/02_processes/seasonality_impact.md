## Seasonality Impact on Shrink and Inventory

### Candy Department Example:
* **Peak Seasons and Increased Risk:** Candy experiences peaks around Valentine's Day, Easter, Halloween, and winter holidays. Increased traffic and merchandise volume lead to a greater likelihood of theft (shrinkage), especially for desirable or high-value items.
* **Inventory Management and Spoilage:** Seasonal candy often requires managing large quantities for limited periods. Perishables need specific storage (temperature, humidity). Effective inventory management (FIFO, accurate forecasting) is crucial to minimize waste from expired/damaged products.

### Asset Protection Strategies (Seasonality):
* **Visibility and Surveillance:** Cameras and good lighting deter shoplifters.
* **Product Placement:** Place high-value/targeted items strategically (less accessible, near checkout).
* **Employee Training:** Recognize shoplifting signs, handle situations appropriately.
* **Inventory Accuracy:** Address internal factors (human error, vendor fraud, damages) through frequent audits, careful delivery checks, clear damage procedures.
* **Beyond Theft:** Asset protection also addresses shrink from spoilage via proper storage and inventory rotation.

### General Seasonal Inventory Fluctuations:
* Retail inventory dollars fluctuate significantly due to seasonality.
* **Anticipating Demand:** Retailers increase inventory levels before peak seasons (e.g., Candy, Lawn & Garden, Toys, Electronics) to meet expected demand.
* **Increased Inventory Value:** Total inventory dollar value rises as more merchandise is stocked.
* **Peak Inventory:** Highest inventory value occurs just before the peak selling period.
* **Sales and Reduction:** Inventory levels and dollar value decrease as customers purchase seasonal items.
* **Post-Season:** Retailers manage remaining inventory, often using markdowns/clearance, significantly lowering inventory dollar value.
* **Financial Impact:** Fluctuations affect working capital, cost of goods sold, and profitability. Effective management is key.
* **Varying by Department:** The degree of fluctuation depends on how strongly sales are tied to seasons (e.g., Fashion, Home Decor also see shifts).
