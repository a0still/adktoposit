# Replenishment and On-Hand Accuracy Guide

## How does the replenishment system work?

The **Replenishment System** automatically orders merchandise based on sales trends and on-hand accuracy to keep shelves stocked for customers.

**Key Principle:** Keep the shelves stocked with accurate on-hands, and the customers do the rest.

**How the Replenishment System operates:**
1. **Updates forecasts weekly** - Captures sales trends from actual sales data over time
2. **Uses past selling history** - Purchases merchandise for cyclical and predictable events
3. **Anticipates seasonal demand** - Buys inventory for Back to School, Halloween, Thanksgiving, etc.
4. **Relies on accurate on-hands** - Makes ordering decisions based on system Perpetual Inventory (PI)

**Critical Point:** The Replenishment System operates on **total belief** in the store's stated Perpetual Inventory (PI). If on-hands are inaccurate, the system makes incorrect ordering decisions.

## What causes inaccurate on-hands in retail stores?

Several common pitfalls can negatively impact **PI (Perpetual Inventory)** accuracy:

**Common Causes of Inaccurate On-Hands:**
- **Breaking a cross-reference chain** (Unlinking related items in the system)
- **Cashiers scanning like items and using the Quantity key** (Example: All cat food cans look the same, cashier scans one and enters quantity 12, but scans wrong UPC)
- **Trucks not received properly** (Receiving quantities don't match actual delivered quantities)
- **Mis-picks at the DC (Distribution Center)** (Wrong items shipped from the Distribution Center)
- **Not scanning high-value items regularly** (On-hands become inaccurate over time)
- **Associates adjusting on-hands without investigation** (Changes made without verifying physical count)

## What happens when on-hands are inaccurate?

Inaccurate on-hands have significant negative effects on store operations and inventory:

### If On-Hands are Understated (PI count under actual on-hand):

**Problem:** System thinks the store has less merchandise than actually present

**Result:** The store receives **excess shipments**
- More merchandise arrives than needed
- Overstock situations develop
- Backroom congestion increases
- Labor increases to stock excess freight

**Example:** System shows 10 units, but store actually has 50 units. System orders 40 more units, creating overstock of 90 units total.

### If On-Hands are Overstated (PI count over actual on-hand):

**Problem:** System thinks the store has more merchandise than actually present

**Result:** The store experiences **out-of-stocks**
- Customers can't find items they want
- Lost sales occur
- Customer satisfaction decreases
- Replenishment system doesn't order because it thinks items are in stock

**Example:** System shows 50 units, but store actually has 10 units. System doesn't order, and store runs out of stock.

## How does on-hand accuracy affect store operations?

Inaccurate PI (Perpetual Inventory) or excessive manipulation of on-hands causes large swings in inventory levels.

**Negative Impacts:**
1. **Labor Pressure** - High manual orders and variable shipment volumes require extra staffing
2. **Freight Variability** - Unpredictable shipment sizes make scheduling difficult
3. **Customer Service** - Out-of-stocks frustrate customers, excess freight clutters sales floor
4. **Inventory Efficiency** - Can't maintain optimal stock levels

**Extreme Example:**
- During physical inventory prep work, many items aren't counted
- Everything not counted goes to zero in the system
- The store gets **inundated with freight** as the Replenishment System tries to replenish all "missing" items
- Creates massive labor and space issues

## How do I maintain accurate on-hands?

To keep Perpetual Inventory (PI) accurate and support effective replenishment:

**Best Practices:**
1. **Scan high-value and high-theft items regularly** - Daily scans of top shrink drivers
2. **Verify receiving quantities** - Count everything, don't trust the BOL (Bill of Lading)
3. **Maintain cross-reference chains** - Don't break item linkages in the system
4. **Train cashiers properly** - Ensure proper scanning procedures (scan each item, don't use Quantity key for different items)
5. **Investigate discrepancies before adjusting** - Find out WHY counts are wrong before changing on-hands
6. **Process changes promptly** - Don't delay adjustments, damages, or markdowns
7. **Prepare thoroughly for physical inventory** - Count everything to avoid zero-out issues

**Key Principle:** Accurate on-hands lead to better replenishment, fewer out-of-stocks, less overstock, and improved customer satisfaction.
