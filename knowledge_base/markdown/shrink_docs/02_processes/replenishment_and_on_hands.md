## Rate of Sale & On-Hand Accuracy

### Rate of Sale
Keep the shelves stocked and the customers do the rest.

* The **Replenishment system** updates the forecast weekly to capture trend from actual sales over time.
* The system also uses past selling history to buy into a season, so the system is purchasing for cyclical and predictable events such as Back to School, Halloween, and Thanksgiving.

### Accurate On-Hands
Keep your on-hands accurate and avoid common pitfalls that can negatively impact PI (Perpetual Inventory):

* Breaking a cross-reference chain.
* Cashiers scanning like items and using the Quantity key (e.g., cat food cans sometimes all look the same).
* Trucks not received properly.
* Mis-picks at the DC (Distribution Center).

### Inaccurate On-Hands Impact
Inaccurate on-hands have a distinct effect on the store.

* If you have **understated on-hands** (PI count under actual on-hand), you will get **excess shipments**.
* If you have **overstated on-hands** (PI count over actual on-hand), you will get **out-of-stocks**.

The replenishment system operates on **total belief** in your stated PI.

Inaccurate PI or excessive manipulation causes large swings in your inventory. These large swings create pressure on labor, through high manual orders and variability in shipments.

An extreme example would be when you go through inventory and the prep work wasn't completed well. Everything not counted goes to zero and you get inundated with freight.
