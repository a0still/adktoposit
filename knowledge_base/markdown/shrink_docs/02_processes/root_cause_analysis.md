# Root Cause Analysis (RCA) for Retail Shrink

## What is Root Cause Analysis?

**Root Cause Analysis (RCA)** is a systematic method used to **prevent problems from happening repeatedly** by identifying and fixing the underlying cause rather than just addressing symptoms.

**Purpose of RCA:**
- Find where the problem originates (root cause)
- Fix the source of the issue, not just the visible outcome
- Prevent the same problem from recurring
- Develop sustainable solutions

**Key Principle:** Don't just fix what you see - fix why it's happening.

## How do I perform Root Cause Analysis for shrink issues?

The **Inventory Recap Report (IRR)** is the primary tool for identifying and investigating shrink issues. Follow this systematic RCA process:

### Step 1: Review Your Inventory Recap Report (IRR)

**What to do:**
1. Open the **Inventory Recap Report (IRR)** - this is your primary tool for identifying shrink issues
2. Look at the **"Book vs SKU"** column to see which departments have the highest variance
3. Identify the **top 3-5 departments** contributing to shrink indicators
4. Compare to **previous months' IRR data** to determine when the problem started and if it's growing

**Why this matters:**
- The IRR shows shrink **indicators** (predictors of potential shrink)
- High Book vs SKU variance indicates a department is likely to experience shrink
- Historical comparison reveals trends (improving, stable, or worsening)

### Step 2: Identify Which Category is Driving the Variance

**CRITICAL:** Once a department with high Book vs SKU variance is identified, determine which category is driving the variance:

**Variance Driver Categories:**

1. **SKU (On-hand Changes or Inaccurate On-hands)**
   - Are on-hands being adjusted down frequently?
   - Could indicate inaccurate counts or poor scanning practices
   - May suggest theft if high-value items consistently missing

2. **Purchases**
   - Is more merchandise coming in than usual?
   - Check receiving accuracy and vendor shipping errors
   - Review for receiving process breakdowns

3. **Markdowns**
   - Are markdowns lower than expected?
   - Could be hiding shrink by not marking down aged inventory
   - May indicate damaged merchandise not processed

4. **Sales**
   - Are sales down but inventory still high?
   - May indicate theft (merchandise leaving without being sold)
   - Could suggest operational issues affecting sales

**How to drill deeper:**
- Use the **Purchases tab** on the IRR Dashboard to review purchase trends and amounts by department
- Use the **Sales tab** to analyze sales patterns and compare to inventory levels
- Review the **SKU/Markdowns columns** to identify specific issues with on-hands or markdown processing

### Step 3: Utilize Additional Data Sources

After identifying the category driver, gather additional information:

**If SKU is the issue:**
- Scan high-value items and verify physical counts match system on-hands
- Look for on-hand adjustment patterns (who, when, why)
- Review exception reports for unusual activity

**If Purchases are high:**
- Review receiving processes and procedures
- Check for vendor shipping errors or short-shipments
- Verify BOL (Bill of Lading) quantities match actual received amounts

**If Markdowns are low:**
- Review for aged inventory that should be marked down
- Check for damaged merchandise not processed
- Verify clearance procedures are being followed

**If Sales are low:**
- Consider reviewing AP1 Queries for theft indicators
- Partner with Asset Protection to investigate
- Check ISA (Integrated Store Assistant) dashboard for operational metrics

## How do I conduct an RCA store tour?

Once research identifies the problem areas, conduct a detailed tour with leadership:

**Tour Preparation:**
1. **Meet with area leaders** - Share the identified data with salaried and hourly leadership
2. **Schedule the tour** - Allow enough time for thorough investigation
3. **Bring documentation** - IRR data, adjustment logs, relevant reports

**During the Tour:**
1. **Tour each alerting area** identified in the IRR analysis
2. **Tour the availability process** - Check merchandise flow and on-hand accuracy
3. **Diagnose indications of theft** - Look for security gaps or high-theft indicators
4. **Interview associates** - Ask about unusual activity or operational issues
5. **Document findings** - Take notes and photos if appropriate

**What to look for:**
- Physical evidence matching the data (missing items, aged inventory, etc.)
- Process breakdowns (receiving errors, markdown delays, etc.)
- Security vulnerabilities (blind spots, unsecured high-value items)
- Associate knowledge gaps (training needs)

## How do I create an action plan after Root Cause Analysis?

Once the root cause is identified, develop a sustainable action plan:

### Action Plan Requirements:

**1. Focus on Root Causes**
- Address the **underlying problem**, not just the symptom
- Example: If receiving errors are the issue, fix receiving procedures (root cause), don't just adjust on-hands (symptom)

**2. Make Actions Sustainable**
- Implement changes that can be maintained long-term
- Ensure sufficient resources and training
- Build into regular store processes

**3. Make Actions Measurable**
- Define specific success metrics
- Set target goals (reduce variance by $X or by X%)
- Establish timeline for improvements

**4. Assign Specific Owners**
- Tie each action to a specific individual
- Clarify roles and responsibilities
- Ensure accountability

**5. Verify Understanding**
- Confirm owners understand their expectations
- Provide necessary training and resources
- Set follow-up checkpoints

**6. Measure Progress**
- Use the following month's **IRR** to measure progress or regression
- Compare variance before and after actions taken
- Track metrics defined in the plan

**7. Adapt as Needed**
- If the action plan didn't deliver expected results, **adapt the approach**
- Investigate why actions didn't work as intended
- Take a partner (supervisor, AP, district leadership) if unsure what to do next

### Example Action Plan:

**Problem:** Department 92 has $5,000 Book vs SKU variance driven by SKU (on-hand errors)

**Root Cause:** Associates not scanning high-value items regularly, leading to inaccurate on-hands

**Action Plan:**
1. **Action:** Implement daily scanning of top 10 high-value items in Department 92
   - **Owner:** Department Manager
   - **Measurable:** Scan completion logged daily, variance reduced by $2,500 in 30 days
   - **Sustainable:** Built into opening checklist

2. **Action:** Train all Department 92 associates on proper scanning procedures
   - **Owner:** Assistant Manager
   - **Measurable:** 100% of associates trained within 2 weeks
   - **Sustainable:** New hire training includes this process

3. **Action:** Weekly variance review meetings for Department 92
   - **Owner:** Store Manager + Department Manager
   - **Measurable:** Weekly meetings documented, trends tracked
   - **Sustainable:** Added to weekly manager meeting agenda

**Follow-up:** Review next month's IRR to confirm Department 92 variance decreased

## What if my action plan doesn't work?

If the action plan doesn't deliver expected results:

**1. Re-investigate**
- Was the root cause correctly identified?
- Are there additional contributing factors?

**2. Review Execution**
- Were actions actually implemented consistently?
- Did associates receive proper training?
- Are there resource constraints?

**3. Seek Partnership**
- Partner with your supervisor or sponsor
- Request Asset Protection support
- Consult district or regional leadership
- Leverage peer stores with similar challenges

**4. Adapt and Try Again**
- Modify the approach based on lessons learned
- Test new solutions
- Continue measuring and adjusting

**Remember:** Root Cause Analysis is iterative. Persistence and adaptation lead to sustainable shrink reduction.
