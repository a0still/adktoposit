## Root Cause Analysis (RCA)

Root cause analysis is used to **prevent problems from happening repeatedly**. It's about finding where the problem starts and fixing it, instead of trying to fix the outcome.

To get to the root cause, you and your management team will need to take deliberate actions.

### Initial RCA Steps:

**Step 1: Review Your Inventory Recap Report (IRR)**
* Start with your **Inventory Recap Report (IRR)** - this is your primary tool for identifying shrink issues
* Look at the "Book vs SKU" column to see which departments have the highest shrink variance
* Identify the top 3-5 departments contributing to shrink
* Compare to **previous months' IRR data** to see when the problem started and if it's growing

**Step 2: Utilize Additional Data Sources and Tools**
* Review AP1 Queries for theft indicators
* Check ISA (Integrated Store Assistant) dashboard for operational metrics
* Look at markdown trends, purchase variances, and inventory accuracy in the IRR

### Performing RCA Tour:
* Once research is done, meet the leaders of those areas and **detail tour together**, using the identified data.
* **Tour each alerting area** with salaried and hourly leadership.
* **Tour the availability process**
* **Diagnose indications of theft**

### Action Planning Post-RCA:
* Once a cause is identified, **action must be taken**.
* Take actions focused on the **root causes**.
* Make sure each action item is **sustainable**.
* Make sure each action item is **measurable**.
* Make sure each action is tied to **specific individuals**.
* Verify owners understand their **expectations**.
* Use the following months **IRR to measure progress/regression**.
* **Adapt** if the action plan did not deliver the expected result.
* Take a partner if you aren't sure what to do next.
