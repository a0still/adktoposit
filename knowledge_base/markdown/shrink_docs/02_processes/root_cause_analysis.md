## Root Cause Analysis (RCA)

Root cause analysis is used to **prevent problems from happening repeatedly**. It's about finding where the problem starts and fixing it, instead of trying to fix the outcome.

To get to the root cause, you and your management team will need to take deliberate actions.

### Initial RCA Steps:

**Step 1: Review Your Inventory Recap Report (IRR)**
* Start with your **Inventory Recap Report (IRR)** - this is your primary tool for identifying shrink issues
* Look at the "Book vs SKU" column to see which departments have the highest variance indicating likely shrink
* Identify the top 3-5 departments contributing to shrink
* Compare to **previous months' IRR data** to see when the problem started and if it's growing

**Step 2: Identify Which Category is Driving the Variance**
**CRITICAL: Once you find a department with high Book vs SKU variance, look at which category is driving your variance:**
* **SKU (On-hand Changes or Inaccurate On-hands)** - Are on-hands being adjusted down frequently? Could indicate inaccurate counts
* **Purchases** - More merchandise coming in than usual? Check receiving accuracy
* **Markdowns** - Not taking markdowns when you should? Could hide shrink
* **Sales** - Sales down but inventory still high? May indicate theft or operational issues

**Use the tabs on the IRR Dashboard to dig deeper:**
* **Purchases tab** - Review purchase trends and amounts by department
* **Sales tab** - Analyze sales patterns and compare to inventory levels  
* **SKU/Markdowns columns** - Identify specific issues with on-hands or markdown processing

**Step 3: Utilize Additional Data Sources (After Identifying Category Driver)**
* If SKU is the issue: Scan high-value items, verify counts, look for adjustment patterns
* If purchases are high: Review receiving processes, check for vendor errors
* If markdowns are low: Review for aged inventory that should be marked down
* If sales are low: Consider reviewing AP1 Queries for theft indicators
* Check ISA (Integrated Store Assistant) dashboard for operational metrics if needed

### Performing RCA Tour:
* Once research is done, meet the leaders of those areas and **detail tour together**, using the identified data.
* **Tour each alerting area** with salaried and hourly leadership.
* **Tour the availability process**
* **Diagnose indications of theft**

### Action Planning Post-RCA:
* Once a cause is identified, **action must be taken**.
* Take actions focused on the **root causes**.
* Make sure each action item is **sustainable**.
* Make sure each action item is **measurable**.
* Make sure each action is tied to **specific individuals**.
* Verify owners understand their **expectations**.
* Use the following months **IRR to measure progress/regression**.
* **Adapt** if the action plan did not deliver the expected result.
* Take a partner if you aren't sure what to do next.
