# How to Use Custom Reports to Research Purchase Charges

## When You Need Further Investigation

If you see variance in the **Purchases** column of the IRR and want to investigate purchase activity, follow these steps:

## Step 1: Identify the Issue in IRR

1. Navigate to the **IRR Dashboard**
2. Look at the **Purchases** tab
3. Note departments or items with unusual purchase variance
4. Go to the details table at the bottom to find the main driver

## Step 2: Access the Proper Report

### Option A: Using Custom Reports Tab in IRR

**Use "NG Receiving Detail" report for:**
- DC Invoice
- Local Receiving
- DSD Receiving
- Warehouse Bottle Fees

**Use "Future reports coming" for:**
- STR-RTCR
- Return Center
- OPT (Optical)
- Pre-Charge Invoices
- Transmittal and MTRs (Merchandise Transfer Report)
- Retail Corrections
- Local Receiving
- DSD Receiving

## Step 3: What to Look For

When reviewing purchase details in the Custom Reports, check for:

### Large Retail Amounts
- Are there any retail amounts that are much higher, lower, or negative than normal trend?
- Compare to historical patterns for that department or item

### Larger Quantities
- Are there higher quantities than normal for this time period?
- Check if quantities align with expected deliveries

### Cost and Retail Mismatches
- Are there situations where cost and retail are not aligned?
- Examples:
  - Cost is negative and retail is positive (indicates one may be incorrect)
  - Retail is much lower or higher than expected based on cost

### Timing Issues
- When was merchandise received or charged?
- When should it have been received or charged?
- Are there delays between receiving and system updates?

## Common Purchase Variance Drivers

### DC Invoice
- Check "NG Receiving Detail" report
- Look for large retail amounts or unusual quantities
- Verify timing of invoice vs. merchandise arrival

### Local Receiving / DSD Receiving
- Check "NG Receiving Detail" report
- Verify quantities received match BOL (Bill of Lading)
- Look for vendor patterns (consistent discrepancies)

### Warehouse Bottle Fees
- Check "NG Receiving Detail" report
- Verify fees are calculated correctly
- Look for unusual fee amounts

### Retail Corrections
- Currently requires alternative system access
- Review correction reasons and amounts
- Verify corrections were necessary and properly documented

### MTRs (Merchandise Transfer Report)
- Currently requires alternative system access
- Check transfer amounts and destinations
- Verify transfers were processed correctly

## Next Steps After Reviewing Reports

1. **Document your findings** - Note specific issues found
2. **Determine root cause** - Is it a receiving error, vendor issue, or system problem?
3. **Take corrective action:**
   - Address procedural issues with team
   - Contact vendors about discrepancies
   - Submit corrections if needed
4. **Follow up** - Verify issue is resolved in next period

- **DC Invoice** - Distribution Center invoice for merchandise received
- **DSD (Direct Store Delivery)** - Merchandise delivered directly to store (not through DC)
- **MTR (Merchandise Transfer Report)** - Transfers between stores or departments
