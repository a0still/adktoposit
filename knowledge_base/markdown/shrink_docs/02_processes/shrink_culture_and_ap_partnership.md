# Creating a Shrink Reduction Culture and Asset Protection Partnership

## How do Store Managers create a shrink reduction culture?

**Store Managers set the expectations** for shrink reduction in the store. The management team and associates will follow the Store Manager's example and priorities.

**Key Principle:** If the Store Manager makes shrink reduction a priority, the entire team will make it a priority.

**How to Establish Shrink Culture:**
1. **Lead by example** - Demonstrate commitment to shrink reduction through actions
2. **Communicate expectations** - Make shrink reduction goals clear to all team members
3. **Review shrink data regularly** - Use the **Inventory Recap Report (IRR)** in team meetings
4. **Celebrate improvements** - Recognize departments and associates who reduce shrink
5. **Hold teams accountable** - Follow up on action plans and measure results
6. **Provide resources** - Ensure training, tools, and support are available
7. **Partner with Asset Protection** - Leverage AP expertise and resources

**Remember:** A strong shrink culture prevents shrink problems before they start, rather than reacting to losses after they occur.

## Why is partnership with Asset Protection important?

**Partnership with Asset Protection (AP)** is a vital tool in shrink reduction that provides expertise, resources, and daily oversight.

**What Asset Protection Brings:**
- **Daily control reviews** - AP monitors security and operational controls every day
- **Fresh perspective** - AP helps identify issues Store Managers may not see
- **Specialized expertise** - Trained in theft detection, investigation, and prevention
- **External theft monitoring** - Cameras, surveillance, and shoplifting prevention
- **Internal theft investigation** - Proper procedures for handling employee theft
- **Data analysis** - Exception reports and pattern recognition

**Key AP Resources:**
- **APOL (Asset Protection Operations Lead)** - Primary AP partner for the store
- **APOC (Asset Protection Operations Coach)** - Strategic partner for district
- **AP1 Queries** - Reports and data for theft indicators
- **Camera systems** - Surveillance and evidence gathering
- **Security equipment** - EAS tags, locks, and theft deterrents

**Remember:** Asset Protection sees things from a security perspective that complements the Store Manager's operational view.

## How do Store Managers partner effectively with Asset Protection?

Implement these partnership strategies to maximize shrink reduction effectiveness:

### 1. Include AP in Regular Shrink Discussions

**Best Practice:**
- **Ask AP to cover a specific shrink reduction topic** in each management meeting
- Examples: High-shrink departments, theft trends, prevention strategies
- Keeps shrink top-of-mind for the entire team

### 2. Conduct Weekly Meetings with APOC

**Schedule:** Weekly meeting with **APOC (Asset Protection Operations Coach)**

**Meeting Agenda Should Include:**

**A. Report Research and Review**
- **Review reports that need attention** such as:
  - Items significantly out of line from normal patterns
  - Year-over-year (YOY) changes in shrink
  - Large dollar variances requiring investigation
  - Exception reports showing unusual activity

**B. AP Overview and Drilldown Analysis**
- **Review AP overview/drilldown** for key risk indicators:
  - **OH (On-Hand) changes** - Unusual adjustment patterns
  - **Scanned out stolen** - Theft documentation trends
  - **Staffing risks** - Schedule gaps or high-risk shifts
  - **Other operational risks** - Security vulnerabilities

**C. Department Tour Planning**
- **Consultation on departments needing tours** based on shrink data
- **Review department condition** from a shrink perspective
- **Prioritize high-shrink areas** for immediate attention
- **Develop tour schedule** and assign responsibilities

**D. Front End Exception Review**
- **Review front end exceptions** - Cashier errors, voids, refunds
- **Research suspicious patterns** - Potential internal theft indicators
- **Implement controls** - Prevent future front end shrink

### 3. Involve AP in Store Tours

**Best Practice:**
- **Invite AP to participate in store tours**, especially in high-shrink departments
- **Combine operational and security perspectives** during tours
- **Identify both theft and process issues** together
- **Develop comprehensive action plans** addressing all root causes

**Benefits of Joint Tours:**
- Store Manager sees operational breakdowns
- AP identifies security vulnerabilities
- Combined expertise leads to better solutions
- Associates see unified leadership focus on shrink

### 4. Share IRR Data and Trends

**Best Practice:**
- **Share Inventory Recap Report (IRR) results** with AP regularly
- **Highlight high-variance departments** requiring investigation
- **Discuss trends** - Are things improving or worsening?
- **Request AP camera review** for suspected theft areas
- **Coordinate action plans** based on data insights

### 5. Implement AP Recommendations

**Best Practice:**
- **Follow through on AP recommendations** for security improvements
- **Install recommended equipment** - EAS tags, cameras, locks
- **Adjust product placement** based on AP suggestions
- **Increase monitoring** in high-risk areas identified by AP
- **Communicate results** back to AP to show value of partnership

## What should Store Managers NOT do regarding Asset Protection?

**Avoid These Common Mistakes:**

1. **Don't attempt apprehensions** - Only trained AP personnel should apprehend shoplifters
2. **Don't investigate internal theft alone** - Partner with AP for proper procedures and documentation
3. **Don't ignore AP recommendations** - If resources are limited, communicate and prioritize
4. **Don't blame AP for shrink** - Shrink is a shared responsibility requiring operational and security solutions
5. **Don't wait for AP to solve shrink** - Store Managers must lead operational shrink reduction efforts

**Remember:** Asset Protection is a partner, not a replacement for Store Manager leadership in shrink reduction.

## How do I measure the success of AP partnership?

**Success Indicators:**
- **Decreasing Book vs SKU variance** shown on monthly IRR
- **Reduced external theft incidents** documented by AP
- **Improved on-hand accuracy** in high-shrink departments
- **Fewer front end exceptions** and cashier errors
- **Increased theft deterrence** - Fewer attempts due to visible security
- **Better communication** between store leadership and AP team
- **Proactive problem-solving** - Issues identified and addressed before they grow

**Use the IRR to measure:** Compare current month shrink indicators to previous months to track improvement from AP partnership initiatives.
