## Creating a Culture of Shrink Reduction

**Store Managers** set the expectations for the store. Your management team will follow your example. If you make shrink reduction a priority, so will your team.

**Partnership with AP** (Asset Protection) is a vital tool in shrink reduction. They are reviewing controls every day and they are going to help you see things that you do not. Remember your APOL (Asset Protection Operations Lead) is also a great partner and resource.

### Store Manager and AP Partnership Ideas:

* Ask your AP to cover something specific for shrink reduction in each meeting.
* Conduct a weekly meeting with your APOC (Asset Protection Operations Coach). Meeting expectations could include:
    * Research for reports that need attention like anything out of line, year over year (YOY) change, or large numbers.
    * Review AP overview/drilldown for OH (On-Hand) changes, scanned out stolen, staffing and other risks.
    * Consultation on departments that need to be toured and their condition from a shrink data perspective.
    * Front end exceptions and research.
* Involve them in tours especially in high shrink departments.
