# Troubleshooting High Book vs SKU Variance

## What does high Book vs SKU variance mean?

When a department or store shows significant **Book vs SKU variance**, the system on-hand inventory (SKU) is lower than the financial records (Book). This indicates a **high likelihood of shrink** on inventory day.

**Understanding the Variance:**
- **Book** = Financial records of what the store should have based on transactions
- **SKU** = System on-hand inventory calculated from current on-hands (approximately 50% accurate)
- **Variance** = Book minus SKU (when Book is higher, shrink is likely)

**Important:** SKU represents system on-hands, NOT physical counts. Actual shrink is only measured during annual physical inventory.

**What High Variance Means:**
- **Missing merchandise** that was purchased but not accounted for
- **Financial losses** affecting store profitability and performance metrics
- **Potential causes:** Theft (external or internal), operational errors, or process breakdowns
- **Action required:** Immediate investigation to identify and address root cause

## What are the common causes of high Book vs SKU variance?

High Book vs SKU variance can result from multiple factors. Identify the specific cause to implement the correct solution:

### 1. **External Theft (Shoplifting)**

**Why it happens:**
- High-value, easily concealable items
- Inadequate security measures or monitoring
- Store layout provides concealment opportunities
- Known high-theft items not properly secured

**How to identify it:**
- Specific items consistently missing
- Variance concentrated in departments with high-theft items
- Pattern during specific times/days
- AP reports confirm theft incidents

### 2. **Internal Theft (Employee Theft)**

**Why it happens:**
- Access to merchandise and systems
- Inadequate oversight or controls
- Financial pressures or opportunity

**How to identify it:**
- Unexplained inventory adjustments
- Missing merchandise from secure areas
- Discrepancies in high-value items
- Pattern associated with specific shifts/employees

### 3. **Inventory Inaccuracy (Counting Errors)**

**Why it happens:**
- Not scanning high-value items regularly
- Not investigating discrepancies before adjusting
- Associates unfamiliar with proper procedures
- Not following daily inventory processes

**How to identify it:**
- Frequent on-hand adjustments
- Counts that don't match previous counts
- Variance spread across many items vs. specific high-value items
- No clear pattern by time or department

### 4. **Receiving Errors**

**Why it happens:**
- Not verifying quantities received
- Trusting BOL (Bill of Lading) without counting
- Vendor short-shipping
- Receiving to wrong items/departments

**How to identify it:**
- Variance appears immediately after receiving
- Specific vendors show patterns
- Discrepancies in newly received items
- BOL quantities don't match actual received

### 5. **Markdown Errors**

**Why it happens:**
- Taking markdowns without proper justification
- Incorrect markdown amounts
- Marking down items not in inventory
- Not following markdown procedures

**How to identify it:**
- High markdown dollars without corresponding damaged merchandise
- Markdown taken but items still at full price
- Unusual patterns in markdown activity
- Markdowns not matching damaged/clearance merchandise

## How do I investigate high Book vs SKU variance?

Follow these systematic investigation steps to identify the root cause of high Book vs SKU variance:

### Step 1: Analyze the Data on the Inventory Recap Report (IRR)

**What to check:**
- IRR Report - Identify which departments have highest variance
- Trend analysis - Is variance increasing or consistent?
- Item-level data - Which specific items are contributing?

**Where to look:**
- IRR Dashboard (this application)
- Item history reports
- Department performance over time

**What to expect:**
- High-shrink departments will stand out
- Patterns may emerge (specific items, times, locations)

### Step 2: Physical Verification

**What to check:**
- Scan high-value items in affected departments and verify counts
- Verify on-hand accuracy for top contributors
- Check for merchandise in wrong locations

**Where to look:**
- Primary shelf locations
- Backroom/overstock
- Wrong departments (merchandise placed incorrectly)
- Returns area

**What to expect:**
- Discrepancies will be confirmed or explained
- May find merchandise in unexpected locations

### Step 3: Review Transactions

**What to check:**
- Recent markdowns in affected departments
- On-hand adjustments (who, when, why)
- Receiving history for the month
- Transfer activity (MTRs)

**Where to look:**
- Markdown reports
- Adjustment logs
- Receiving reports
- Transfer documents

**What to expect:**
- Unusual patterns may emerge
- Errors or suspicious activity may be identified

### Step 4: Partner with Asset Protection

**What to check:**
- Known theft incidents in affected departments
- Camera footage for high-shrink areas
- ORC (Organized Retail Crime) activity
- Internal theft indicators

**Where to look:**
- AP reports and incident logs
- Camera system (with AP)
- Exception reports

**What to expect:**
- AP may have insights on theft patterns
- Video evidence may be available
- Recommendations for security improvements

### Step 5: Interview Associates

**What to check:**
- Are associates following proper procedures?
- Have they noticed anything unusual?
- Do they understand scanning processes, markdowns, receiving?
- Are there operational issues they've identified?

**Where to look:**
- Talk to department associates
- Consult with department managers
- Check with receiving team

**What to expect:**
- Insights on operational issues
- Potential witnesses to theft
- Training needs identified

## What solutions should I implement based on the cause?

Once the root cause of high Book vs SKU variance is identified, implement targeted solutions:

### If Cause is External Theft (Shoplifting):

1. **Increase security measures**
   - Add EAS tags to high-theft items
   - Improve camera coverage
   - Increase associate presence in affected areas
   - Implement merchandise placement changes

2. **Enhance monitoring**
   - Scan high-risk items more frequently
   - Implement daily scans and on-hand verification for top 10 shrink items
   - Review camera footage proactively

3. **Expected outcome**
   - Variance should decrease within 1-2 months
   - Theft deterrence measures visible
   - Pattern changes as thieves move to easier targets

### If Cause is Internal Theft:

1. **Work with Asset Protection**
   - Follow AP recommendations
   - Document policy violations
   - Ensure proper investigation

2. **Implement controls**
   - Increase oversight in affected areas
